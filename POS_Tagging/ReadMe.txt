1. Project Title:
   - Recurrent Neural Architectures for Part-of-Speech Tagging: A Comparative Study on English Penn TreeBank Dataset

2. Project Description:
   - This project explores and compares various recurrent neural architectures for Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging, a crucial task in natural language processing. The study aims to identify the most effective model based on F1 score performance. Using the English Penn TreeBank dataset, the paper investigates and evaluates the proposed models through qualitative and quantitative error analyses, providing insights into their performance compared to a baseline model.

3. Usage:
  - Run the provided Python notebook in the repository. The notebook automates the installation of required packages using pip. 

4. Data:
   - The project utilizes a version of the English Penn TreeBank dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nltk/nltk_data/gh-pages/packages/corpora/dependency_treebank.zip).
