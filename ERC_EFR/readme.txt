1. Project Title
   - Emotion Recognition in Conversations and Emotion-Flip Reasoning

2. Project Description
   - This project focuses on Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) and Emotion-Flip Reasoning (EFR). 
     ERC aims to decipher emotions expressed in a sequence of utterances, while EFR identifies trigger utterances inducing changes in emotional states during conversations. 
     The project utilizes a BERT-based model with an LSTM component, tailored for both tasks and applied to the MELD dataset.

3. Usage
   - Run the python notebook included in the repository, the run should automatically trigger the installation of the needed packages using pip. 

4. Data
   - The dataset used in this study is derived from MELD (Multimodal EmotionLines Dataset), a resource designed for in-depth analysis of emotions and sentiments in dialogues extracted from movies.
