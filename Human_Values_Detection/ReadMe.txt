# Human Values Classification with BERT-based Models

## Project Title
   - Human Values Classification with BERT-based Models

## Project Description
   - In recent years, the advancement in classifying argumentative text into categories has seen significant progress. This project specifically focuses on the identification of four macro categories of "human values" â€“ openness to change, self-enhancement, conservation, and self-transcendence. Leveraging pre-trained BERT models, particularly the "bert-base-uncased" model, the task involves employing distinct binary classification heads for each category.

## Usage
   - Run the provided Python notebook in the repository. The notebook automates the installation of required packages using pip.

## Data
   - The data used for this study was extracted from provided dataset, with a step to combine lower-order categories into macro categories. The dataset is organized into a Pandas DataFrame, including true labels for macro categories: Openness to change, Self-enhancement, Conservation, and Self-transcendence.
